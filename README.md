## Purpose

These files are provided as a resource to accompany an article. While
code listings are generally included in my technical articles, it can be
more convenient to download the examples rather than having to type them
in.

## Installation and Setup
Installation of [VirtualBox][2] and [Vagrant][1] are prerequisites.

    dir="$HOME/Documents/puppet-docker"
    mkdir -p "$dir"
    cd "$dir"
    git clone https://github.com/CodeGnome/MDIP-Examples

## Command-Line Usage

    # Configure the example VM with Vagrant and VirtualBox.
    ./vagrant_provisioning.sh

## Caveats

Most of the "how-to" associated with these scripts will be in the body
of the article (when published). While these scripts may have some
indepdenent utility, you'll have to wait for the article to see print if
you want a walkthrough of what each script does, and what it's intended
to demonstrate.
